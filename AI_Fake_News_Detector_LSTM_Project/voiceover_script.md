# Voice-Over Script: AI Fake News Detector

**Platform:** Instagram Reels  
**Duration:** ~75-90 seconds  
**Tone:** Gen-Z but formal, accessible, criticism-proof

---

## HOOK (0-3 seconds)

**"Can AI spot fake news before you fall for it?"**

---

## INTRODUCTION (3-12 seconds)

I built this to show how machine learning tackles misinformation.

Trained on over a thousand headlines—learning to separate real journalism from clickbait.

---

## THE PROBLEM (12-22 seconds)

Fake headlines have patterns: all caps, emotional manipulation, words like "SHOCKING" or "doctors HATE this."

Real news? Neutral, factual tone.

The AI learned these differences.

---

## THE SOLUTION (22-38 seconds)

It's a CNN-LSTM neural network—convolutional layers detect patterns, LSTM cells understand word sequences.

Text goes through an embedding layer, gets processed by 64 filters, outputs a confidence score: trustworthy or suspect.

---

## THE DEMO (38-58 seconds)

Watch it analyze headlines—green for credible, red for suspicious.

87% accuracy with 89% recall—catches most fake news while staying reliable.

Type your own headline, hit analyze—it breaks down language patterns and credibility markers.

---

## THE IMPACT (58-72 seconds)

This is educational, not production software.

It shows how AI addresses real problems like misinformation—helping people understand the tech and think critically.

---

## CALL TO ACTION (72-90 seconds)

Built with TensorFlow, Keras, Python—purely for learning.

Shows how machine learning can tackle social challenges.
